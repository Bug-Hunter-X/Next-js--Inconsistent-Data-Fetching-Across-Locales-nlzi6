In Next.js, a subtle issue can arise when using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` with data fetching that depends on the locale. If your data fetching logic isn't explicitly aware of and handles the locale, you might inadvertently fetch the same data regardless of the user's locale.  This could lead to the wrong translations being displayed or other locale-dependent inconsistencies. For example, if your data source contains localized content and you only fetch once without considering the locale, users from all regions would only see one version of this content. This is especially problematic with dynamic routes that might rely on locale-based parameters in their path.
